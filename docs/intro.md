# MotherBored Intro

## Mission Statement: 

- Boring Protocol is purpose-built to provide no-cost privacy and earning potential to all dVPN node operators by enabling individuals worldwide to earn token rewards by distributing robust connectivity. These hardware nodes allow users to communicate anonymously, in a secure, obfuscated, and low-cost manner, helping grow a self-sustaining, borderless, censorship-resistant network.


## What is Boring Protocol? 

- Boring Protocol is a web3 powered decentralized VPN, <i>or dVPN</i> built on the Solana Blockchain, allowing users to pay with BOP, the network's native token, by the Gb rather than a subscription membership. Boring Protocol utilizes the privacy of web3-based authentication and payments with BOP token incentives for node operators designed to organically grow Boring's global people-built network, and provides a peer-to-peer bandwidth market to conduct transactions between node providers and bandwidth users.
