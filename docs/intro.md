# MotherBored Intro

## Mission Statement: 

- Boring Protocol enables individuals worldwide to earn token rewards by linking our environmentally friendly dVPN nodes with organic decentralized robust connectivity. Boring Protocol is purpose-built to become ubiquitous and inclusive by providing earning potential and no-cost communications for all dVPN node operators. These hardware nodes provide the public with the ability to communicate in an anonymous, secure, obfuscated, and low-cost manner across the world. Thereby helping to grow a self-sustaining borderless, inherently censorship-resistant, low-cost network for the next billion people.


## What is Boring Protocol? 

Boring Protocol is a Web3-powered decentralized VPN, <i>or dVPN</i> built on the Solana Blockchain, allowing users to pay with BOP, the network's native token, by the Gb rather than a subscription membership. Boring Protocol utilizes the privacy of web3-based authentication and payments with BOP token incentives for node operators designed to organically grow Boring's global people-built network, and provides a peer-to-peer bandwidth market to conduct transactions between node providers and bandwidth users.
