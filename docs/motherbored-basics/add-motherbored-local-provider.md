# Add Local Provider

Instructions written by the lords of web3 documentation!

1. Select ‘Add Motherbored Provider’
    d. Choose your option, then press INSTALL CONFIG (only once). The Node will download and reboot. (It might take a few min the first time)
9. Confirm you are still connected to ‘boring’ WIFI - again, the node will reboot and may temporarily kick you off while it resets.
10. Once config is installed and the system rebooted, WiFi reconnected, launch https://motherbored.app/ again, then PRESS ‘Activate’ (only once).
11. Once Activated - you will see a confirmation, and the information on the bottom left of the node page will be filled out (ID, Kind, Boring Setupkey, Boring PubKey) this will confirm you are good to go and setup properly.
** NOTE: If you plan to run multiple boring nodes - be sure to change the SSID at the bottom of the page so you can connect to your node again - (ex., Change to boring2, boring3, etc.) - then save. 

Once finished, your node should be set and ready to use. If set to consumer mode make sure to pick your peer in the list then simply connect any devices you want to 'boring' WIFI and bore a secure path through your very own dVPN node!
