# Add Consumer dVPN access for your node

## Select ‘Add Motherbored Consumer’


1. Connect to your MotherBored's WIFI (Default SSID 'boring' PW: motherbored)
    - Launch https://motherbored.app (Andriod users must use in wallet browser)
    - Select ‘Add Motherbored Consumer' button.
    - On the next page 'NEW CONSUMER PEER' please choose the peer name you want to use. Toggle with arrow. Then press 'CREATE' once
    - On the next page configure your local WiFi settings (SSID, Password, and Channel) - Once done press 'Save Changes'. You will see the message 'Syncing peer'.
    - When ready to activate press 'INSTALL CONFIG' just once. The Node will download your configuration and reboot. It might take a few min the first time.

2. Once rebooted (3 min) confirm you are reconnected to your motherbored WiFi SSID to proceed. If this is the first time setting up your MotherBored proceed to the next step otherwise your MotherBored is now ready to use in Consumer Mode.

3. If this is the first time setting up your MotherBored this is when you activate it. Once config is installed, the system is rebooted, and WiFi is reconnected,
 launch https://motherbored.app/ again, Select your then press ACTIVATE just once.

4. Once activated you will see a confirmation, and the information on the bottom left of the node page will be filled out.
 (ID, Kind, Boring Setupkey, Boring PubKey) this will confirm you are good to go and setup properly.

** NOTE: If you plan to run multiple boring nodes, be sure to change the SSID at the bottom of the page so you can connect to your node again - (ex., Change to boring2, boring3, etc.) - then save.

Once finished, your node should be ready to use. If set to consumer mode, make sure to pick your peer in the list then simply connect any devices you'd like to 'boring' WiFi and bore a secure path through your very own dVPN node!

*** Please choose one configuration type and load it and do not change it at this time or you will be forced to re-flash your SD card to a fresh image to re-gain access to your node. We are working on a fix for this.***
